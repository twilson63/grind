# TheGrind

A Project Tracking Application

This application will allow you to create projects and track the status
and percent complete.  You can have one to many stakeholders per project
and they can be also be flagged as a participant.  If they are a
participant, then they can update the status of the project.  If they
are not, they will just get notified of the updated status.

When a user logs in, they see a current timeline or latest statuses of
all the projects they are following on the left, and a list of projects
they are following on the right.
